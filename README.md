# Settlement Simulator

[🟢 Live Demo](https://settlement-simulator-88372a08cee5.herokuapp.com/)

## ✏️ Project Description

This app attempts to showcase a settlement process between two parties, Party A and Party B. The system handles iterative negotiation of settlement amounts by Party A, along with approvals or objections from Party B. The process ensures that all changes and responses are reflected on Party A's and Party B's interface in real time.

To test the app I suggest you run the start script and then open up 2 browser windows both on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Choose Party A on one window and Party B on another one and place them side by side.

## 💻 Development Environment

This project was developed with the following environment:

- **Node** v21.7.3
- **npm** v10.5.0

## 📄 Available Scripts

To start the app run:
