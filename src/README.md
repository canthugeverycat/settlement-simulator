# Client Documentation

This governs the client documentation for the app that allows for settlement disputes between two parties.

## üíª Development Environment

The server was developed using the following modules:

- **NodeJS** v21.7.3
- **Create React App** v5.0.1

## üìÑ Available Scripts

To start the app run the command in the root of the project:

### `npm start`

This will start the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üåä Application flow

### Landing Screen

Greets you once the app is opened. From here, you may choose your party, either A or B and progress to the next screen.

### Settlement Screen

This is the main screen of the app. Depending on your party this is the place where you can submit or respond to a settlement.

In addition, at the bottom you will see the last update from the oposing party.

When you change a settlement, the amount and status will automatically update for both parties.

</div>

### History Screen

Allows you to view the full history for the current negotiation. The most recent results are displayed at the top.

## üß± Main structure & organization

`assets`\
--[*file*].[svg|png|jpeg|ttf]\
`globals`\
--[*file].ts\
`styles`\
--[*file*].css\
`utils`\
--[*file*].ts\
`store`\
--[`entity`]\
`routes`\
--[`route`]\
`components`\
--[`component`]

## üå† Assets

A folder containing visual assets for the app. This is usually a home to **fonts**, **images** and **icons**.

## üåç Globals

Houses .ts files which are used globally thoughout the app. Currently we have:

- `const`.ts
- `types`.ts

All the constants are placed in **const.ts** and used from here. This enables easy changes to urls, property names, etc.

Global TypeScript types are also defined in **types.ts**.

## üé® Styles

Holds base styles for the app, overrides for tailwind classes and custom classes and animations.

## üî® Utils

Contains utility functions and services.

- `api`.ts
- `functions`.ts
- `useWebsocket`.ts

**api.ts** holds all the HTTP functions that are used to communicate with the server.

**functions.ts** holds helper functions like datetime formatters, calculations, etc.

**useWebsocket.ts** a custom hook that wraps a WebSocket module and allows for cleaner usage.

## üì¶ Store

A **Redux** store is used to persist the data to the app.

Store structure:

index.ts\
rootReducer.ts\
`settlements`\
--action-types.ts\
--actions.ts\
--reducers.ts

Settlement Model:

```js
// Settlement
Settlement = {
  id: number,
  createdAt: datetime,
  status: Status,
  party: Party,
  amount: number,
};

// Party
Party = 'a' || 'b';

// Status
Status = 'pending' || 'accepted' || 'rejected';
```

Each entity is its' own separate folder with appropriate actions and reducers. This organization allows for greater scalability as the app grows.

## üö∏ Routes

Routes (screens) used throughout the app.

Route structure:

`history`\
--index.tsx\
`landing`\
--index.tsx\
`settlement`\
--index.tsx\

## üßä Components

This folder houses the components as the building blocks of the app.

### Button

A styled button component, allows for different sizing and color options through props.

### InputForm

A component that holds the amount input and the action buttons. Holds a fair amount of display logic as well.

### Loader

Simple pulsing loader, usually used to indicate a pending API action. Screenshot doesn't do it justice.

### Logo

## üß† To improve

### Testing

Add testing throughout the app. RTL for unit and integration testing and Happo for visual regression testing.

### Error Handling

Error handling hasnt been covered in the app, UI-wise. The store could be easily extended to allow for storing of errors and the UI could display an appropriate message to the user in form of a toast element.

### Notifications

Add notifications using the Notification API. The notifications would fire for the user any time the oposing party submits a new change.

Given that we are dealing with sensitive information such as settlement amounts, I would keep the messages informative but vague.

_e.g. "Party B responded to your submission!"_\
_e.g. "Party A submitted a new amount!"_
